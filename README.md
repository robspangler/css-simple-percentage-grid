# Simple Percentage Grid v1.0

Grid frameworks are generally way too bloated. This is a simple 12 column grid, initially based off of 960px with 20px gutters that has been converted to percentages. So, it works in any sized new or pre-existing layout.

##Basic Example

```html
<div class="row">
 <div class="column eight">Eight Columns</div>
 <div class="column four">Four Columns</div>
</div>
```
